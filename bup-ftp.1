.SH NAME
bup\-ftp \- ftp\-like client for navigating bup repositories
.SH SYNOPSIS
bup ftp
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]bup ftp\f[R] is a command\-line tool for navigating bup
repositories.
It has commands similar to the Unix \f[CR]ftp\f[R](1) command.
The file hierarchy is the same as that shown by \f[CR]bup\-fuse\f[R](1)
and \f[CR]bup\-ls\f[R](1).
.PP
Note: if your system has the python\-readline library installed, you can
use the <tab> key to complete filenames while navigating your backup
data.
This will save you a lot of typing.
.SH COMMANDS
The following commands are available inside \f[CR]bup ftp\f[R]:
.TP
ls [\-s] [\-a] [\f[I]path\f[R]]
print the contents of a directory.
If no path argument is given, the current directory\[cq]s contents are
listed.
If \-a is given, also include hidden files (files which start with a
\f[CR].\f[R] character).
If \-s is given, each file is displayed with its hash from the bup
archive to its left.

download the contents of \f[I]filename\f[R] and save it to disk as
\f[I]localname\f[R].
If \f[I]localname\f[R] is omitted, uses \f[I]filename\f[R] as the local
name.
