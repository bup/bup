.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-ftp \- ftp\-like client for navigating bup repositories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup ftp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup ftp\f[R] is a command\-line tool for navigating bup
repositories.
It has commands similar to the Unix \f[C]ftp\f[R](1) command.
The file hierarchy is the same as that shown by \f[C]bup\-fuse\f[R](1)
and \f[C]bup\-ls\f[R](1).
.PP
Note: if your system has the python\-readline library installed, you can
use the <tab> key to complete filenames while navigating your backup
data.
This will save you a lot of typing.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
The following commands are available inside \f[C]bup ftp\f[R]:
.TP
.B ls [\-s] [\-a] [\f[I]path\f[R]]
print the contents of a directory.
If no path argument is given, the current directory\[cq]s contents are
listed.
If \-a is given, also include hidden files (files which start with a
\f[C].\f[R] character).
If \-s is given, each file is displayed with its hash from the bup
archive to its left.

name.
