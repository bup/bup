.SH NAME
.PP
bup-drecurse - recursively list files in your filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup drecurse [-x] [-q] [--exclude \f[I]path\f[]] [--exclude-from
\f[I]filename\f[]] [--profile] <path>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ drecurse\f[] traverses files in the filesystem in a way
similar to \f[C]find\f[](1).
In most cases, you should use \f[C]find\f[](1) instead.
.PP
This program is useful mainly for testing the file traversal algorithm
used in \f[C]bup-index\f[](1).
.PP
Note that filenames are returned in reverse alphabetical order, as in
\f[C]bup-index\f[](1).
This is important because you can\[aq]t generate the hash of a parent
directory until you have generated the hashes of all its children.
When listing files in reverse order, the parent directory will come
after its children, making this easy.
