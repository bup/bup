.SH NAME
.PP
bup-newliner - make sure progress messages don\[aq]t overlap with
output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
<any command> 2>&1 | bup newliner
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bup\ newliner\f[] is run automatically by bup\. You
shouldn\[aq]t need it unless you\[aq]re using it in some other
program\.
.PP
Progress messages emitted by bup (and some other tools) are of the
form \"Message ### content\", that is, a status message containing
a variable-length number, followed by a carriage return character
and no newline\. If these messages are printed more than once, they
overwrite each other, so what the user sees is a single line with a
continually-updating number\.
.PP
This works fine until some other message is printed\. For example,
progress messages are usually printed to stderr, but other program
messages might be printed to stdout\. If those messages are shorter
than the progress message line, the screen will be left with weird
looking artifacts as the two messages get mixed together\.
.PP
\f[B]bup\ newliner\f[] prints extra space characters at the right
time to make sure that doesn\[aq]t happen\.
.PP
If you\[aq]re running a program that has problems with these
artifacts, you can usually fix them by piping its stdout
\f[I]and\f[] its stderr through bup newliner\.
