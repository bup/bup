.SH NAME
bup\-join \- concatenate files from a bup repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
bup join [\-r \f[I]host\f[R]:\f[I]path\f[R]] [refs or hashes\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]bup join\f[R] is roughly the opposite operation to
\f[CR]bup\-split\f[R](1).
You can use it to retrieve the contents of a file from a local or remote
bup repository.
.PP
The supplied list of refs or hashes can be in any format accepted by
\f[CR]git\f[R](1), including branch names, commit ids, tree ids, or blob
ids.
.PP
If no refs or hashes are given on the command line, \f[CR]bup join\f[R]
reads them from stdin instead.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-r, \-\-remote=\f[I]host\f[R]:\f[I]path\f[R]
Retrieves objects from the given remote repository instead of the local
one.
\f[I]path\f[R] may be blank, in which case the default remote repository
is used.
The connection to the remote server is made with SSH.
If you\[cq]d like to specify which port, user or private key to use for
the SSH connection, we recommend you use the
\f[CR]\[ti]/.ssh/config\f[R] file.
Even though the data source is remote, a local bup repository is still
required.
.SH EXAMPLES

# split and then rejoin a file using its tree id

# mybackup\[ti]1 is git(1) notation for the second most
# recent commit on the branch named mybackup.
tar \-cvf \- /etc | bup split \-n mybackup
tar \-cvf \- /etc | bup split \-n mybackup
