Notable changes in 0.32.2 since 0.32.1
======================================

Bugs
----

* `bup gc` should no longer remove stale packfiles before it creates
  the new midx at the end of a run.  This could cause midx to complain
  about missing files, e.g.:

        warning: index pack-....idx missing

Build system
------------

* The automated FreeBSD tests have moved from 12.1 to 12.4 and to
  Python 3.9, and have dropped testing of Python 2.

* The automated macOS tests have moved from Catalina to Monterey and
  from x86 to ARM.

Thanks to (at least)
