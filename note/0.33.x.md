Notable changes in main since 0.33.3 (incomplete)
=================================================

May require attention
---------------------

* Previously, any `bup on REMOTE ...` commands that attempted to read
  from standard input (for example `bup on HOST split < something` or
  `bup on HOST split --git-ids ...`) would read nothing instead of the
  original content of standard input.  Now those commands will either
  reject the invocation, or just crash when they attempt to read a
  closed stream.

Bugs
----

* `bup-config(5)` has been added, and mentions that at the moment `bup
  on REMOTE ...` incorrectly reads the `pack.packSizeLimit` from the
  `REMOTE` repository.

* `bup fsck` no longer requires a repository via `BUP_DIR`, `-d`,
  etc. when paths are provided on the command line.

Thanks to (at least)
