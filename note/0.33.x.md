Notable changes in 0.33.x (incomplete)
======================================

May require attention
---------------------

* `bup split --copy` now writes the split data to standard output
  instead of Python memoryview representations like

      <memory at 0x7f7a89358ac0><memory at 0x7f7a89358a00>...

Bugs
----

* `bup on HOST get ...` should no longer hang in some situations where
  the client could provoke duplicate index-cache suggestions from the
  server, which the client then treated as an error.

Thanks to (at least)
