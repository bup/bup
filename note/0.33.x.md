Notable changes in 0.33.x since 0.33.4 (incomplete)
===================================================

General
-------

* `bup join` now reports the path to any missing object it encounters.

Bugs
----

* `bup get` should no longer be able to leave the repository with
  incomplete trees or commits if it's interrupted at the wrong time.
  Previously it fetched objects "top down", and so if it was
  interrupted after the parent tree/commit was written to the
  repository, but before all the children were written, then the
  repository would be left with an incomplete tree.

* `bup` should always ignore midx files that refer to missing indexes.
  Previously it might not notice when objects had disappeared (via
  `gc`) which could, in particular, cause remote/client operations
  like a remote save to decide that the repository already contained
  data that it did not.

* `bup midx` `--auto` and `--force` now delete midx files that refer
  to missing indexes.

Build system
------------

* [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) `dot` is optional, but must be
  available in order to render the figures referred to by
  issue/missing-objects.md.
