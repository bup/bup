======================================

Bugs

* Internal subcommands (all except `import-rdiff-backup` and
  `import-rsnapshot`) should no longer truncate their output sometimes
  when run interactively (e.g. `bup ls ...`) due to a problem
  introduced in 0.33.8.

* When running interactively, `bup` should no longer lose exceptions
  raised by the internal "output filter" thread.

Thanks to (at least)
