Notable changes in 0.33.x since 0.33.4 (incomplete)
===================================================

Bugs
----

* `bup get` should no longer be able to leave the repository with
  incomplete trees or commits if it's interrupted at the wrong time.
  Previously it fetched objects "top down", and so if it was
  interrupted after the parent tree/commit was written to the
  repository, but before all the children were written, then the
  repository would be left with an incomplete tree.

Build system
------------

* [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) `dot` is optional, but must be
  available in order to render the figures referred to by
  issue/missing-objects.md.

Thanks to (at least)
