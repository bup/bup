Notable changes in 0.33.x since 0.33.4 (incomplete)
===================================================

Bugs
----

* `bup gc` should no longer risk leaving the repository with
  incomplete tree or commit objects -- trees or commits with
  references to objects that are no longer in the repository.

  Previously this could happen because the collection was
  probabilistic with respect to all object types, and so it could
  leave (completely orphaned) vestigial commits or trees that referred
  to objects that had been removed.  It could also do this if the
  `--threshold` caused it to keep a parent in one "live enough" pack,
  while discarding a descendant in a pack that doesn't cross the
  threshold.

  These objects can cause serious trouble because they can be re-used
  as-is (without noticing that they are incomplete) by other commands
  like `bup get`.

* `bup get` should no longer be able to leave the repository with
  incomplete trees or commits if it's interrupted at the wrong time.
  Previously it fetched objects "top down", and so if it was
  interrupted after the parent tree/commit was written to the
  repository, but before all the children were written, then the
  repository would be left with an incomplete tree.

* `bup` should always ignore midx files that refer to missing indexes.
  Previously it might not notice when objects had disappeared (via
  `gc`) which could, in particular, cause remote/client operations
  like a remote save to decide that the repository already contained
  data that it did not.

* `bup midx` `--auto` and `--force` now delete midx files that refer
  to missing indexes.

Build system
------------

* [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) `dot` is optional, but must be
  available in order to render the figures referred to by
  issue/missing-objects.md.
