Notable changes in 0.32.1 since 0.32
====================================

Bugs
----

* POSIX1e ACLs should be restored more correctly now.

  Previously bup incorrectly restored default (`ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT`)
  ACLs as access acls (`ACL_TYPE_ACCESS`).  When both existed, it
  restored the access ACL first and then the default ACL as an access
  ACL.  Now, bup should restore each with the proper type.  This issue
  only affects saves created on platforms where bup currently supports
  ACLs, so presumably mostly just saves created on Linux since the
  current ACL support depends on non-standard functions like
  `acl_extended(3)`.

  There is one remaining issue, which isn't fixed in this release, but
  is fixed in 0.33.1 (because fixing it here could create saves that
  are backward incompatible with 0.33).

  The problem is that in this version and older versions, bup stores
  ACLs in the `acl_to_any_text(3)` format with a newline delimiter,
  when the standard (and `acl_from_text(3)` which restore depends on)
  requires commas.  This may cause restores that include ACLs (likely
  only those from Linux right now) to fail on some platforms
  (e.g. Cygwin).

Build and install
-----------------

* pytest 7 is now supported.
