Notable changes in 0.33.10 since 0.33.9
=======================================

Bugs
----

* As noted in 0.33.8, `bup fsck` switched from symlinks to hardlinks
  to accommodate an incompatible change in `par2` 1.0's behavior.  To
  allow the use of filesystems without hardlinks, `bup` now copies the
  input files if hardlinking fails.

Thanks to (at least)
