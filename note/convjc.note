I am not at all happy and very frustrated and uncomfortable with Mesh/Mnj always asking about "What discussion you want to do with Jtn ?", "How much time of discussion you're going to have with him ?", "Why you need to discuss with him ?"
What does it matter ??
Jtn is also a snr dvloper like me(and everyone else here) and he also knows the importance of his time, so neither me nor he will spend too much time in discussion..
Also I am discussing with him related to my tckts only then why is that such a big deal ?
Whatever the tickets I am assigned are of the level that no one here (in WebMaxtrix) knows about how to headstart it or how to begin with ? Nor they have any idea of, if there is already a functionality in-built in CakePHP/Slim or if we have already developed a functionality for any other area or module or not.
Then Whom do you think should I approach for discussion(and some initial guidance, both general & technical) regarding this type of ticket ?

I thought this company and organization was more concerned with "How many tickets are being done perfectly and how much code and performance standards are we following ?" instead of "Which developer is having discussion with which developer and upto what time ?"
If this cmpany is more concerned about the latter, then do let me know, so I can make my decision to join somewhere else, where teamwork and team-communication are appreciated...
