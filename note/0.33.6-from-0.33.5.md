Notable changes in 0.33.6 since 0.33.5
======================================

Bugs
----

* `bup` should now always include the effective group ID when
  retrieving groups via getgroups(2) (often via python
  `os.getgroups()`).  That call is not required to include the
  effective group ID, and in the Debian buildds' current sbuild
  unshares, it doesn't.

Build system
------------

* `make install` should now place bup-config(5) in the correct
  sectional directory.

Thanks to (at least)
