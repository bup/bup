[0.31 has not been released yet, so these notes are incomplete.]

Notable changes in 0.31
=======================

May require attention
---------------------

* `bup version --tag` has been removed.  It was actually a synonym for
  `bup version`, which still works fine.  The fact that the version
  may have a corresponding git tag is no longer relevant to the
  command.

General
-------

Bugs
----

* It should no longer be posible for the content of archives generated
  by `git archive` (including releases retrieved from github) to vary
  based on the current set of repository refs (tags, branches, etc.).

Build system
------------

Thanks to (at least)
