.SH NAME
bup\-ls \- list the contents of a bup repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
bup ls [\-r \f[I]host\f[R]:[\f[I]path\f[R]]] [OPTION\&...]
<paths\&...>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]bup ls\f[R] lists files and directories in your bup repository
using the same directory hierarchy as they would have with
\f[CR]bup\-fuse\f[R](1).
.PP
The top level directory contains the branch (corresponding to the
\f[CR]\-n\f[R] option in \f[CR]bup save\f[R]), the next level is the
date of the backup, and subsequent levels correspond to files in the
backup.
.PP
When \f[CR]bup ls\f[R] is asked to output on a tty, and \f[CR]\-l\f[R]
is not specified, it formats the output in columns so it can list as
much as possible in as few lines as possible.
However, when \f[CR]\-l\f[R] is specified or bup is asked to output to
something other than a tty (say you pipe the output to another command,
or you redirect it to a file), it will print one file name per line.
This makes the listing easier to parse with external tools.
.PP
Note that \f[CR]bup ls\f[R] doesn\[cq]t show hidden files by default and
one needs to use the \f[CR]\-a\f[R] option to show them.
Files are hidden when their name begins with a dot.
For example, on the topmost level, the special directories named
\f[CR].commit\f[R] and \f[CR].tag\f[R] are hidden directories.
.PP
Once you have identified the file you want using \f[CR]bup ls\f[R], you
can view its contents using \f[CR]bup join\f[R] or \f[CR]git show\f[R].
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-r, \-\-remote=\f[I]host\f[R]:[\f[I]path\f[R]]
list information for the repository at \f[I]path\f[R] on the indicated
\f[I]host\f[R].
If \f[I]path\f[R] is omitted, uses the default path on the remote server
(you still need to include the `:').
The connection to the remote server will be made by SSH.
If you\[cq]d like to specify the port, user, or private key, we
recommend you use the \f[CR]\[ti]/.ssh/config\f[R] file
(\f[CR]ssh_config(5)\f[R]).
.TP
\-s, \-\-hash
show hash for each file/directory.
.TP
\-a, \-\-all
show hidden files.
.TP
\-A, \-\-almost\-all
show hidden files, except \[lq].\[rq] and \[lq]..\[rq].
.TP
\-d, \-\-directory
show information about directories themselves, rather than their
contents, and don\[cq]t follow symlinks.
.TP
\-l
provide a detailed, long listing for each item.
.TP
\-F, \-\-classify
append type indicator: dir/, symlink\[at], fifo|, socket=, and
executable*.
.TP
\-\-file\-type
append type indicator: dir/, symlink\[at], fifo|, socket=.
.TP
\-\-human\-readable
