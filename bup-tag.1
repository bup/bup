.SH NAME
.PP
bup-tag - tag a commit in the bup repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup tag
.PP
bup tag <tag name> <committish>
.PP
bup tag -d <tag name>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bup\ tag\f[] lists, creates or deletes a tag in the bup
repository\.
.PP
A tag is an easy way to retreive a specific commit\. It can be used
to mark a specific backup for easier retrieval later\.
.PP
When called without any arguments, the command lists all tags that
can be found in the repository\. When called with a tag name and a
commit ID or ref name, it creates a new tag with the given name, if
it doesn\[aq]t already exist, that points to the commit given in
the second argument\. When called with \[aq]-d\[aq] and a tag name,
it removes the given tag, if it exists\.
.PP
bup exposes the contents of backups with current tags, via any
command that lists or shows backups\. They can be found under the
/\.tag directory\. For example, the \[aq]ftp\[aq] command will show
the tag named \[aq]tag1\[aq] under /\.tag/tag1\.
.PP
Tags are also exposed under the branches from which they can be
reached\. For example, if you create a tag named
\[aq]important\[aq] under branch \[aq]computerX\[aq], you will also
be able to retrieve the contents of the backup that was tagged
under /computerX/important\. This is done as a convenience, and
should the branch \[aq]computerX\[aq] be deleted, the contents of
the tagged backup will be available through /\.tag/important as
long as the tag is not deleted\.
