  >DESCRIPTION</h1
  ><p
  ><code
    >bup fsck</code
    > is a tool for validating bup repositories in the same way that <code
    >git fsck</code
    > validates git repositories.</p
  ><p
  >It can also generate and/or use &quot;recovery blocks&quot; using the <code
    >par2</code
    >(1) tool (if you have it installed). This allows you to recover from damaged blocks covering up to 5% of your <code
    >.pack</code
    > files.</p
  ><p
  >In a normal backup system, damaged blocks are less important, because there tends to be enough data duplicated between backup sets that a single damaged backup set is non-critical. In a deduplicating backup system like bup, however, no block is ever stored more than once, even if it is used in every single backup. If that block were to be unrecoverable, <em
    >all</em
    > your backup sets would be damaged at once. Thus, it's important to be able to verify the integrity of your backups and recover from disk errors if they occur.</p
  ><p
  ><em
    >WARNING</em
    >: bup fsck's recovery features are not available unless you have the free <code
    >par2</code
    >(1) package installed on your bup server.</p
  ><p
  ><em
    >WARNING</em
    >: bup fsck obviously cannot recover from a complete disk failure. If your backups are important, you need to carefully consider redundancy (such as using RAID for multi-disk redundancy, or making off-site backups for site redundancy).</p

If you run too many jobs at once, your disk will get saturated by seeking back and forth between files and performance will actually decrease, even if <em
	>numjobs</em
	> is less than the number of CPU cores on your system. You can experiment with this option to find the optimal value.</p
