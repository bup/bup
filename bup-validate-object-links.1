links
.SH SYNOPSIS
bup validate\-object\-links
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]bup validate\-object\-links\f[R] scans the objects in the
repository for and reports any \[lq]broken links\[rq] it finds,
i.e.\ any links from a tree or commit in the repository to an object
that doesn\[cq]t exist.
Currently, it doesn\[cq]t include \[lq]loose objects\[rq] (those not in
packfiles \[en] which git may create, but bup doesn\[cq]t), and it
can\[cq]t handle tag objects (which bup also doesn\[cq]t create).
.PP
Whenever a broken link (missing reference) is found, an ASCII encoded
line formatted like this will be printed to standard output:
.IP
.EX
no MISSING_HASH for PARENT_HASH
.EE
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status will be 1 if any broken links are found, 0 if none are
found, and some other positive integer for other failures.
