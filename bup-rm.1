.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-rm \- remove references to archive content (CAUTION: EXPERIMENTAL)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup rm [\-#|\-\-verbose] <\f[I]branch\f[R]|\f[I]save\f[R]\&...>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup rm\f[R] removes the indicated \f[I]branch\f[R]es (backup sets)
and \f[I]save\f[R]s.
By itself, this command does not delete any actual data (nor recover any
storage space), but it may make it very difficult or impossible to refer
to the deleted items, unless there are other references to them
(e.g.\ tags).
.PP
A subsequent garbage collection, either by a \f[C]bup gc\f[R], or by a
normal \f[C]git gc\f[R], may permanently delete data that is no longer
reachable from the remaining branches or tags, and reclaim the related
storage space.
.PP
NOTE: This is one of the few bup commands that modifies your archive in
intentionally destructive ways.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
increase verbosity (can be used more than once).
.TP
.B \-\f[I]#\f[R], \-\-compress=\f[I]#\f[R]
set the compression level to # (a value from 0\-9, where 9 is the
highest and 0 is no compression).
The default is 6.
Note that \f[C]bup rm\f[R] may only write new commits.
