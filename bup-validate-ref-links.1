.SH NAME
bup\-validate\-ref\-links \- check repository refs for links to missing
objects
.SH SYNOPSIS
bup validate\-ref\-links [\f[I]ref\f[R]\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]bup validate\-ref\-links\f[R] checks repository references
(e.g.\ saves) for commits or subtrees that refer to missing objects and
reports the paths to any found.
If no \f[I]ref\f[R]s are provided, checks all refs, otherwise only
checks those specified.
.PP
This command can also be used to validate a save more quickly than
attempting a \f[CR]restore\f[R] or \f[CR]join\f[R]ing the save to
/dev/null, and much more quickly for multiple related saves, though it
only checks for the existence of the leaf (blob) data, it does not
attempt to read that data.
.PP
At the moment, the broken path information is only logged to standard
error, and is not well specified (i.e.\ suitable for inspection, but not
parsing).
.PP
Also note that the current implementation may not report all paths to a
given missing object because it only examines each unique tree or commit
object once, no matter how often it appears within the refs being
examined.
This means that in order to find every broken save, you would need to
run the command separately for each ref, which is likely to be much more
expensive than a combined run because it can\[cq]t skip subtrees that it
has encountered before.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status will be 1 if any broken links are found, 0 if none are
found, and some other positive integer for other failures.
