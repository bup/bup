    >DESCRIPTION</h1
    ><p
    ><code
      >bup split</code
      > concatenates the contents of the given files (or if no filenames are given, reads from stdin), splits the content into chunks of around 8k using a rolling checksum algorithm, and saves the chunks into a bup repository. Chunks which have previously been stored are not stored again (ie. they are 'deduplicated').</p
    ><p
    >Because of the way the rolling checksum works, chunks tend to be very stable across changes to a given file, including adding, deleting, and changing bytes.</p
    ><p
    >For example, if you use <code
      >bup split</code
      > to back up an XML dump of a database, and the XML file changes slightly from one run to the next, nearly all the data will still be deduplicated and the size of each backup after the first will typically be quite small.</p
    ><p
    >Another technique is to pipe the output of the <code
      >tar</code
      >(1) or <code
      >cpio</code
      >(1) programs to <code
      >bup split</code
      >. When individual files in the tarball change slightly or are added or removed, bup still processes the remainder of the tarball efficiently. (Note that <code
      >bup save</code
      > is usually a more efficient way to accomplish this, however.)</p
    ><p
    >To get the data back, use <code
      >bup-join</code
      >(1).</p

	  >--keep-boundaries</code
	  >, each file is split separately. You still only get a single tree or commit or series of blobs, but each blob comes from only one of the files; the end of one of the input files always ends a blob.</p
