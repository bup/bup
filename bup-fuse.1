.SH NAME
bup\-fuse \- mount a bup repository as a filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
bup fuse [\-d] [\-f] [\-o] <mountpoint>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]bup fuse\f[R] opens a bup repository and exports it as a
\f[CR]fuse\f[R](7) userspace filesystem.
.PP
This feature is only available on systems (such as Linux) which support
FUSE.
.PP
\f[B]WARNING\f[R]: bup fuse is still experimental and does not enforce
any file permissions!
All files will be readable by all users.
.PP
When you\[cq]re done accessing the mounted fuse filesystem, you should
unmount it with \f[CR]umount\f[R](8).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-d, \-\-debug
run in the foreground and print FUSE debug information for each request.
.TP
\-f, \-\-foreground
run in the foreground and exit only when the filesystem is unmounted.
.TP
\-o, \-\-allow\-other
permit other users to access the filesystem.
Necessary for exporting the filesystem via Samba, for example.
.TP
\-\-meta
report some of the original metadata (when available) for the mounted
paths (currently the uid, gid, mode, and timestamps).
Without this, only generic values will be presented.
This option is not yet enabled by default because it may negatively
affect performance, and note that any timestamps before 1970\-01\-01 UTC
(i.e.\ before the Unix epoch) will be presented as 1970\-01\-01 UTC.
.TP
\-v, \-\-verbose
increase verbosity (can be used more than once).
.SH EXAMPLES

.EX
rm \-rf /tmp/buptest

sudo bup fuse \-d /tmp/buptest
