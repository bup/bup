.SH NAME
.PP
bup-midx - create a multi-index (\.midx) file from several \.idx
files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup midx [-o \f[I]outfile\f[]] <-a|-f|\f[I]idxnames\f[]\.\.\.>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bup\ midx\f[] creates a multi-index (\.midx) file from one or
more git pack index (\.idx) files\.
.PP
Note: you should no longer need to run this command by hand\. It
gets run automatically by \f[B]bup-save\f[](1) and similar
commands\.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -o, --output=\f[I]filename\.midx\f[]
use the given output filename for the \.midx file\. Default is
auto-generated\.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -a, --auto
automatically generate new \.midx files for any \.idx files where
it would be appropriate\.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -f, --force
force generation of a single new \.midx file containing
\f[I]all\f[] your \.idx files, even if other \.midx files already
exist\. This will result in the fastest backup performance, but may
take a long time to run\.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B --dir=\f[I]packdir\f[]
specify the directory containing the \.idx/\.midx files to work
with\. The default is $BUP_DIR/objects/pack and
$BUP_DIR/indexcache/*\.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B --max-files
maximum number of \.idx files to open at a time\. You can use this
if you have an especially small number of file descriptors
available, so that midx can complete (though possibly
non-optimally) even if it can\[aq]t open all your \.idx files at
once\. The default value of this option should be fine for most
people\.

.SH DISCUSSION
.PP
By default, bup uses git-formatted pack files, which consist of a
pack file (containing objects) and an idx file (containing a sorted
list of object names and their offsets in the \.pack file)\.
.PP
Normal idx files are convenient because it means you can use
\f[B]git\f[](1) to access your backup datasets\. However, idx files
can get slow when you have a lot of very large packs (which git
typically doesn\[aq]t have, but bup often does)\.
.PP
bup \.midx files consist of a single sorted list of all the objects
contained in all the \.pack files it references\. This list can be
binary searched in about log2(m) steps, where m is the total number
of objects\.
.PP
To further speed up the search, midx files also have a
variable-sized fanout table that reduces the first n steps of the
binary search\. With the help of this fanout table, bup can narrow
down which page of the midx file a given object id would be in (if
it exists) with a single lookup\. Thus, typical searches will only
need to swap in two pages: one for the fanout table, and one for
the object id\.
.PP
midx files are most useful when creating new backups, since
searching for a nonexistent object in the repository necessarily
requires searching through \f[I]all\f[] the index files to ensure
that it does not exist\. (Searching for objects that \f[I]do\f[]
exist can be optimized; for example, consecutive objects are often
stored in the same pack, so we can search that one first using an
MRU algorithm\.)
