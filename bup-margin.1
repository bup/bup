.SH NAME
.PP
bup-margin - figure out your deduplication safety margin
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup margin [options\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[V]bup margin\f[R] iterates through all objects in your bup
repository, calculating the largest number of prefix bits shared between
any two entries.
This number, \f[V]n\f[R], identifies the longest subset of SHA-1 you
could use and still encounter a collision between your object ids.
.PP
For example, one system that was tested had a collection of 11 million
objects (70 GB), and \f[V]bup margin\f[R] returned 45.
That means a 46-bit hash would be sufficient to avoid all collisions
among that set of objects; each object in that repository could be
uniquely identified by its first 46 bits.
.PP
The number of bits needed seems to increase by about 1 or 2 for every
doubling of the number of objects.
Since SHA-1 hashes have 160 bits, that leaves 115 bits of margin.
Of course, because SHA-1 hashes are essentially random, it\[cq]s
theoretically possible to use many more bits with far fewer objects.
.PP
If you\[cq]re paranoid about the possibility of SHA-1 collisions, you
can monitor your repository by running \f[V]bup margin\f[R] occasionally
to see if you\[cq]re getting dangerously close to 160 bits.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
--predict
Guess the offset into each index file where a particular object will
appear, and report the maximum deviation of the correct answer from the
guess.
This is potentially useful for tuning an interpolation search algorithm.
.TP
--ignore-midx
don\[cq]t use \f[V].midx\f[R] files, use only \f[V].idx\f[R] files.
This is only really useful when used with \f[V]--predict\f[R].
