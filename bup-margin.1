.SH NAME
.PP
bup-margin - figure out your deduplication safety margin
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup margin [options\.\.\.]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bup\ margin\f[] iterates through all objects in your bup
repository, calculating the largest number of prefix bits shared
between any two entries\. This number, \f[B]n\f[], identifies the
longest subset of SHA-1 you could use and still encounter a
collision between your object ids\.
.PP
For example, one system that was tested had a collection of 11
million objects (70 GB), and \f[B]bup\ margin\f[] returned 45\.
That means a 46-bit hash would be sufficient to avoid all
collisions among that set of objects; each object in that
repository could be uniquely identified by its first 46 bits\.
.PP
The number of bits needed seems to increase by about 1 or 2 for
every doubling of the number of objects\. Since SHA-1 hashes have
160 bits, that leaves 115 bits of margin\. Of course, because SHA-1
hashes are essentially random, it\[aq]s theoretically possible to
use many more bits with far fewer objects\.
.PP
If you\[aq]re paranoid about the possibility of SHA-1 collisions,
you can monitor your repository by running \f[B]bup\ margin\f[]
occasionally to see if you\[aq]re getting dangerously close to 160
bits\.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --predict
Guess the offset into each index file where a particular object
will appear, and report the maximum deviation of the correct answer
from the guess\. This is potentially useful for tuning an
interpolation search algorithm\.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B --ignore-midx
don\[aq]t use \.midx files, use only \.idx files\. This is only
really useful when used with \f[B]--predict\f[]\.
