# NAME

bup-rm - remove references to archive content (CAUTION: EXPERIMENTAL)

# SYNOPSIS

bup rm [-#|\--verbose] <*branch*|*save*...>

# DESCRIPTION

`bup rm` removes the indicated *branch*es (backup sets) and *save*s.
By itself, this command does not delete any actual data (nor recover
any storage space), but it may make it very difficult or impossible to
refer to the deleted items, unless there are other references to them
(e.g. tags).

A subsequent garbage collection, either by a `bup gc`, or by a normal
`git gc`, may permanently delete data that is no longer reachable from
the remaining branches or tags, and reclaim the related storage space.

NOTE: This is one of the few bup commands that modifies your archive
in intentionally destructive ways.

# OPTIONS

-v, \--verbose
:   increase verbosity (can be used more than once).

-*#*, \--compress=*#*
:   set the compression level to # (a value from 0-9, where
    9 is the highest and 0 is no compression).  The default
    is 6.  Note that `bup rm` may only write new commits.

# EXAMPLES

    # Delete the backup set (branch) foo and a save in bar.
    $ bup rm /foo /bar/2014-10-21-214720
