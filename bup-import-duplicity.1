.SH NAME
bup\-import\-duplicity \- import duplicity backups
.SH WARNING
bup\-import\-duplicity is \f[B]EXPERIMENTAL\f[R] (proceed with caution)
.SH SYNOPSIS
bup import\-duplicity [\-n] <source\-url> <save\-name>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]bup import\-duplicity\f[R] imports all of the duplicity backups at
\f[CR]source\-url\f[R] into \f[CR]bup\f[R] via
\f[CR]bup save \-n save\-name\f[R].
The bup saves will have the same timestamps (via
\f[CR]bup save \-\-date\f[R]) as the original backups.
.PP
Because this command operates by restoring each duplicity backup to a
temporary directory, the extent to which the metadata is preserved will
depend on the characteristics of the underlying filesystem, whether or
not you run \f[CR]import\-duplicity\f[R] as root (or under
\f[CR]fakeroot\f[R](1)), etc.
.PP
Note that this command will use \c
.UR https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkdtemp
\f[CR]mkdtemp\f[R]
.UE \c
\ to create temporary directories, which means that it should respect
any \f[CR]TEMPDIR\f[R], \f[CR]TEMP\f[R], or \f[CR]TMP\f[R] environment
variable settings.
Make sure that the relevant filesystem has enough space for the largest
duplicity backup being imported.
.PP
Since all invocations of duplicity use a temporary
\f[CR]\-\-archive\-dir\f[R], \f[CR]import\-duplicity\f[R] should not
affect \[ti]/.cache/duplicity.
