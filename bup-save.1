.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-save \- create a new bup backup set
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup save [\-r \f[I]host\f[R]:\f[I]path\f[R]] <\-t|\-c|\-n
\f[I]name\f[R]> [\-#] [\-f \f[I]indexfile\f[R]] [\-v] [\-q]
[\-\-smaller=\f[I]maxsize\f[R]] <paths\&...>;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup save\f[R] saves the contents of the given files or paths into a
new backup set and optionally names that backup set.
.PP
Note that in order to refer to your backup set later (i.e.\ for
restoration), you must either specify \f[C]\-\-name\f[R] (the normal
case), or record the tree or commit id printed by \f[C]\-\-tree\f[R] or
\f[C]\-\-commit\f[R].
.PP
Before trying to save files using \f[C]bup save\f[R], you should first
update the index using \f[C]bup index\f[R].
The reasons for separating the two steps are described in the man page
for \f[C]bup\-index\f[R](1).
.PP
By default, metadata will be saved for every path, and the metadata for
any unindexed parent directories of indexed paths will be taken directly
from the filesystem.
However, if \f[C]\-\-strip\f[R], \f[C]\-\-strip\-path\f[R], or
\f[C]\-\-graft\f[R] is specified, metadata will not be saved for the
root directory (\f[I]/\f[R]).
See \f[C]bup\-restore\f[R](1) for more information about the handling of
metadata.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-remote=\f[I]host\f[R]:\f[I]path\f[R]
save the backup set to the given remote server.
If \f[I]path\f[R] is omitted, uses the default path on the remote server
(you still need to include the `:').
The connection to the remote server is made with SSH.
If you\[cq]d like to specify which port, user or private key to use for
the SSH connection, we recommend you use the \f[C]\[ti]/.ssh/config\f[R]
file.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-tree
after creating the backup set, print out the git tree id of the
resulting backup.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-commit
after creating the backup set, print out the git commit id of the
resulting backup.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-name=\f[I]name\f[R]
after creating the backup set, create a git branch named \f[I]name\f[R]
so that the backup can be accessed using that name.
If \f[I]name\f[R] already exists, the new backup will be considered a
descendant of the old \f[I]name\f[R].
(Thus, you can continually create new backup sets with the same name,
and later view the history of that backup set to see how files have
changed over time.)
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-date=\f[I]date\f[R]
specify the date of the backup, in seconds since the epoch, instead of
the current time.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-indexfile=\f[I]indexfile\f[R]
use a different index filename instead of \f[C]$BUP_DIR/bupindex\f[R].
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
increase verbosity (can be used more than once).
With one \-v, prints every directory name as it gets backed up.
With two \-v, also prints every filename.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
disable progress messages.
.TP
.B \-\-smaller=\f[I]maxsize\f[R]
don\[cq]t back up files >= \f[I]maxsize\f[R] bytes.
You can use this to run frequent incremental backups of your small
files, which can usually be backed up quickly, and skip over large ones
(like virtual machine images) which take longer.
Then you can back up the large files less frequently.
Use a suffix like k, M, or G to specify multiples of 1024,
1024\f[I]1024, 1024\f[R]1024*1024 respectively.
.TP
.B \-\-bwlimit=\f[I]bytes/sec\f[R]
don\[cq]t transmit more than \f[I]bytes/sec\f[R] bytes per second to the
server.
This is good for making your backups not suck up all your network
bandwidth.
Use a suffix like k, M, or G to specify multiples of 1024,
1024\f[I]1024, 1024\f[R]1024*1024 respectively.
.TP
.B \-\-strip
strips the path that is given from all files and directories.
.RS
.PP
A directory \f[I]/root/chroot/etc\f[R] saved with \[lq]bup save \-n
chroot \-\-strip /root/chroot\[rq] would be saved as \f[I]/etc\f[R].
Note that currently, metadata will not be saved for the root directory
(\f[I]/\f[R]) when this option is specified.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-strip\-path=\f[I]path\-prefix\f[R]
strips the given path prefix \f[I]path\-prefix\f[R] from all files and
directories.
.RS
.PP
A directory \f[I]/root/chroot/webserver/etc\f[R] saved with \[lq]bup
save \-n webserver \-\-strip\-path=/root/chroot
/root/chroot/webserver/etc\[rq] would be saved as
\f[I]/webserver/etc\f[R].
Note that currently, metadata will not be saved for the root directory
(\f[I]/\f[R]) when this option is specified.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-graft=\f[I]old_path\f[R]=\f[I]new_path\f[R]
a graft point \f[I]old_path\f[R]=\f[I]new_path\f[R] (can be used more
than once).
.RS
.PP
A directory \f[I]/root/chroot/a/etc\f[R] saved with \[lq]bup save \-n
chroot \-\-graft /root/chroot/a=/chroot/a\[rq] would be saved as
\f[I]/chroot/a/etc\f[R].
Note that currently, metadata will not be saved for the root directory
(\f[I]/\f[R]) when this option is specified.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\f[I]#\f[R], \-\-compress=\f[I]#\f[R]
set the compression level to # (a value from 0\-9, where 9 is the
highest and 0 is no compression).
The default is 1 (fast, loose compression)
